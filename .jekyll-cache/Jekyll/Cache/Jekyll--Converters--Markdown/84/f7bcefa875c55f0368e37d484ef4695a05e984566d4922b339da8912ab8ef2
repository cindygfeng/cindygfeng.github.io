I"ˆ<p>Work in progress! Last updated: 07-18-2020</p>

<p>Iâ€™m a part time grad student in the <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/machines/" target="_blank"><b>University of Washington Machine Agency lab</b></a>.  I am working under the guidance of Professor Nadya Peek and HCDE PhD candidate Joshua Vasquez.  My research project is building an open-source, extensible multi-tool motion platform (CNC machine) called <a href="https://www.jubilee3d.com" target="_blank"><b>Jubilee</b></a>. I am always super happy to chat about the project!</p>

<h3 id="summer-2020-current">Summer 2020 (Current)</h3>

<p>I graduated from my Masters program but I was so excited to keep on working on Jubilee through the summer.</p>

<p>Current progress as of July 18: I have been using Jubilee to 3D print many things this summer. I am still in the process of fine tuning the multi-material 3D printing. After that, I plan on making custom tool heads to take the project beyond 3D printing. Check back later for updates.</p>

<p>And here is a video of a tool change!</p>

<h3 id="spring-2020">Spring 2020</h3>

<p>In Spring 2020, because of the closure of UW campus due to COVID-19, the Machine Agency was kind enough to deliver the components so I can work on Jubilee from home.</p>

<p>As of June 11, 2020, the machine is a functioning dual extruder 3D printer. The machineâ€™s first duty once I got the first 3D extruder head running in May was to print parts for itself (no more dangling EMI filter!), including parts for a second extruder head. I also added some photos and contributed to pages on the <a href="https://www.jubilee3d.com" target="_blank"><b>Jubilee project wiki</b></a>.</p>

<p>Full extruder head assembly with wiring harness:</p>

<p>Upon start up, the tool carriage is empty so that it can home all X, Y, Z, and U axes. The XY axes is the belt drive. the Z axes is the toolbed, and the U axis is the tool changer lock.</p>

<p>After sending a print in gcode format to the printer, it heats up the extruder tool to the userâ€™s set temperature and heats up the bed. When set temperatures are reached, the tool carriage picks up the tool to start printing.</p>

<p>I followed wiring diagrams for the <a href="https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Duet_Wiring_Diagrams/" target="_blank"><b>Duet 2</b></a> and <a href="https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Duex_wiring_diagrams/" target="_blank"><b>Duex 5</b></a> boards that are on the machine.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/jubilee/jubilee-05022020.jpg" alt="frame-assembly" /></p>

<p>I also found it helpful to label the wires that plug into the boards.</p>

<p>Here is an old time lapse (5x speed) of it homing the X, Y, and Z axes. It automatically levels the tool bed.</p>

<p>And of course, never forget the tool squad:</p>

<h3 id="winter-2020">Winter 2020</h3>

<p>My team of 3 grad students delved into the instructions of building Jubilee, and got as far as the frame, shown below.  We focused on improving documentation and learning how to operate an existing model of Jubilee.</p>
