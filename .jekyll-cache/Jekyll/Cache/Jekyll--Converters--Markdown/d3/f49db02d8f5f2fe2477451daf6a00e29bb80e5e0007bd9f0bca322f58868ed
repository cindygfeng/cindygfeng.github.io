<p><b><strong><em>NOTE: I am the owner of all the photos and gifs below and you cannot use them without my permission</em></strong><b></b></b></p>

<p>I‚Äôm a part time grad student in the <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/machines/" target="_blank"><b>University of Washington Machine Agency lab</b></a>.  I am working under the guidance of Professor Nadya Peek and HCDE PhD candidate Joshua Vasquez.  My research project is building an open-source, extensible multi-tool motion platform (CNC machine) called [<b>Jubilee</b>](‚Äúhttps://jubilee3d.com‚Äù_blank‚Äù}. I am always super happy to chat about the project!</p>

<p>Goals: Make custom tool heads, contribute to project documentation and open source community. Check back later for updates!</p>

<p>In Spring 2020, because of the closure of UW campus due to COVID-19, the Machine Agency was kind enough to deliver the components so I can work on Jubilee from home.</p>

<p>As of June 11, 2020, the machine is a functioning dual extruder 3D printer. The machine‚Äôs first duty once I got the first 3D extruder head running in May was to print parts for itself (no more dangling EMI filter!), including parts for a second extruder head, which is partially build in the image below. I also added some photos and contributed to pages on the project wiki: https://jubilee3d.com.</p>

<p>Full extruder head assembly with wiring harness:</p>

<p>Upon start up, the tool carriage is empty so that it can home all X, Y, Z, and U axes. The XY axes is the belt drive. the Z axes is the toolbed, and the U axis is the tool changer lock.</p>

<p>After sending a print in gcode format to the printer, it heats up the extruder tool to the user‚Äôs set temperature and heats up the bed. When set temperatures are reached, the tool carriage picks up the tool to start printing. [To add: video of multi-material printing and toolchanging]</p>

<p>I followed wiring diagrams for the <a href="https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Duet_Wiring_Diagrams/" target="_blank"><b>Duet 2</b></a> and <a href="https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Duex_wiring_diagrams/" target="_blank"><b>Duex 5</b></a> boards that are on the machine.</p>

<p>I also found it helpful to label the wires that plug into the boards.</p>

<p>After some troubleshooting, grease, and rebuilding, the machine is moving! Here is a video of it homing the X, Y, and Z axes. It automatically levels the tool bed.</p>

<p>My team of 3 grad students delved into the instructions of building Jubilee, and got as far as the frame, shown below.  We focused on improving documentation and learning how to operate an existing model of Jubilee.</p>
