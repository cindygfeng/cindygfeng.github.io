Work in progress! Last updated: 05-02-2020

I'm a part time grad student in the [<b>University of Washington Machine Agency lab</b>](https://depts.washington.edu/machines/){:target="_blank"}.  I am working under the guidance of Professor Nadya Peek and HCDE PhD candidate Joshua Vasquez.  My research project is building an open-source, extensible multi-tool motion platform (CNC machine) called [<b>Jubilee</b>](https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee){:target="_blank"}.


### Spring 2020 (Right now!)

In Spring 2020, because of the closure of UW campus due to COVID-19, my lab was kind enough to deliver the components so I can work on Jubilee from home! Here is a photo of current progress from my living room.  I followed wiring diagrams for the [<b>Duet 2</b>](https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Duet_Wiring_Diagrams/){:target="_blank"} and [<b>Duex 5</b>](https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Duex_wiring_diagrams/){:target="_blank"} boards that are on the machine.

I also found it helpful to label the wires that plug into the boards.

My next steps are to update the firmware on the Duet 2 board, which I need a micro SD to USB adapter for, and I am waiting for that to be shipped. After that I can get the machine moving and move on to tuning.  In the meantime I'll be working on documentation on the project's Github page.

Check back later for updates!


### Winter 2020

My team of 3 grad students delved into the instructions of building Jubilee, and got as far as the frame, shown below.  We focused on improving documentation and learning how to operate an existing model of Jubilee.
